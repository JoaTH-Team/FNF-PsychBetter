## Build this engine (STILL IN PROGRESS)
1. Install `hmm` for install needed haxelib library for this engine
    - Please go to this page for [install `hmm`](https://lib.haxe.org/p/hmm/)
    - After that, open the terminal on the root project and type `hmm install`
    - Wait for the `hmm` done install all haxelib library needed
2. Compile the game
    - If you using **Linux**, you can just type `haxelib run lime build linux`
        - If cannot compile the game due to missing `g++`, install `g++` by using `sudo apt-get install g++` (Ubuntu/Debian)
    - If you using **Windows**, you will need [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), you can also install the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) by using `msvc-win.bat` on the `setup` folder

And That all for this Engine, eyyyy
